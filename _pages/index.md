Hi :-)

My name is Martino Sani. I'm an <strong>IT Security Consultant</strong> focused on application security, such as web application penetration test and secure code auditing.

I work as Core Security Researcher at [Cobalt.io](https://app.cobalt.io/ilsani){:target="_blank"}, a crowdsourced SaaS penetration testing platform. For fun and [sometimes] profit I try to find bugs on bug bounty platforms, such as [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/ilsani?sort_type=latest_disclosable_activity_at&filter=type%3Aall%20from%3Ailsani&page=1&range=forever){:target="_blank"}.

From 2011 to 2014 and from 2016 to 2017 I worked as <strong>Software Engineer</strong> at [Blue Eye Solutions](http://www.besolutions.it){:target="_blank"}, a software house based in Parma, Italy. Here I developed document flow software using Java, Microsoft .NET Framework and Angular2. My main activities were: R&D projects, legacy code maintenance and guarantee the correctness of the delivered software following the day to day software development life cycle and delivery processes.

From 2014 to 2016 I worked as <strong>IT Security Consultant</strong> at [Emaze](https://www.emaze.net){:target="_blank"}, a security company based in Milan, Italy. Here I performed multiple types of Security Assessments (vulnerability assessment/penetration testing) for medium and large corporates, such as web application, infrastructure and mobile security analysis in black/white box mode.

I hold some certifications such as:

- [Offensive Security Certification Expert (OSCE)](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/osce-offensive-security-certified-expert/){:target="_blank"}
